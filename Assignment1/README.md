## Mini Bank Project  Due 10/21/22 @ 11:59pm 
#### CS121.1 Fall 2022 [ Code Analysis ]
### You will create a branch for each member of your group. 
### Next, you will split up the .java files equally and assign each team member to a certain amount of files.

### - Identify and describe what is happening in the miniBank code for each below (commenting in each file of the code). 
### - Then I would like you to add the structure of the code below with the relationships of each class to each other. (I will explain in class to clarify).
### - Each group member will place what file they worked on. Then each member will update if they have started on the file, work in progress or if they have finished.

-instances of variables
- keywords
- creating objects
- the subclass
- the super class
- setter methods 
- getter methods
- arrayList
